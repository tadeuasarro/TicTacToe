- The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

- You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.

- The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

- When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.



## Built With

- Ruby,


## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites
You need to have Ruby installed in your machine

### Setup
You can make the main file executable in linux by changing the permissions with the following command:

- chmod 755 main.rb

After doing this you can run it by simply typing in the console ./main.rb

### Install
In order to run, you need to install RUBY in your computer. For windows you can go to [Ruby installer](https://rubyinstaller.org/) and for MAC and LINUX you can go to [Ruby official site](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) for intructions on how to intall it.

And it goes back and forth until the game ends. 

If the player has the chance to win then the game will tell before you place your move
